## Agent

Defines the Elastic Agent configuration.

```yaml
outputs: #...
inputs: #...
mode: #...
```
---

`outputs` _<DocLink id="agentConfigReference" section="output" text="map[string]Output" />_

: One or more output configurations that specify where to send data.
You can pair specific inputs with specific outputs.

---

`inputs` _<DocLink id="agentConfigReference" section="input" text="[]Input" />_

: List of input configurations that specify how to locate and processes data.
By default Elastic Agent collects system metrics, such as cpu, memory, network, and filesystem metrics, and sends them to the default output. 

---

`mode` _string_

: The managementment mode for Elastic Agent.

    Valid values:

    - `local` (default)
    - `whatelse`

{/* Not sure how tricky this is ^^, but where we provide a list of valid values, would be good to indicate the default in the list itself. */}

{/* There is only one valid value shown in the example. Is the other value `fleet`? */}

---

## Output

{/* I'm not sure what the best way of doing this is */}

Defines an Elastic Agent output configuration. Can be an elasticsearch or
logstash output configuration.

{/* Would be nice to have links here, but as you can see, our syntax is kind of verbose. Not sure we want to embed this in comments. */}

## Elasticsearch

Defines an Elasticsearch output configuration.

```yaml
default:
  type: elasticsearch
  hosts: [127.0.0.1:9200]
  api-key: "example-key"
  # username: "elastic"
  # password: "changeme"
```

---

`hosts` _[]string_

: A list of Elasticsearch nodes to connect to.
The events are distributed to these nodes in round robin order.
If one node becomes unreachable, the event is automatically sent to another node.	

---

`api-key` _string_

: The API key to use for token-based authentication.

---

`username` _string_

: The basic authentication username for connecting to Elasticsearch.

---

`password` _string_

: The basic authentication password for connecting to Elasticsearch.

---

## Input

Defines an Elastic Agent input configuration.

## Config

{/* The struct name is Config, but I think we need something more descriptive. Maybe Filestream input Can we automate this?  */}

Defines a filestream input configuration.

---

`id` _string_

: The ID of blah blah blah

---

`data_stream` _<DocLink id="agentConfigReference" section="datastream" text="typ.DataStream" />_

: The data stream to send events to.

---

`paths` _[]string_

: A list of glob-based paths that will be crawled and fetched.

---

`use_output` _string_

: The output to use for this filestream output.

---

## Datastream

Defines the datastream used by an input.

---

{/* I think this is wrong, but I'm not sure how the struct maps to what I see in the refernece yaml.  */}

`type` _string_

: The type of blah blah blah.

---

{/* How will we document available datasets? It's gonna be A LOT. */}

`dataset` _string_

: The dataset to use to fetch and structure data.
The dataset name must conform to the naming conventions for Elasticsearch indices.
The name cannot contain dashes (-) or exceed 100 bytes.

---

`namespace` _string_

: A user-configurable arbitrary grouping, such as an environment (dev, prod, or qa), a team, or a strategic business unit.
A namespace can be up to 100 bytes in length (multibyte characters will count toward this limit faster).

## Config

{/* Again the struct name is Config, but I think we need something more descriptive. Maybe something like TCP input. Can we automate this?  */}

Defines a tcp input configuration.

---

`port` _int_

: The TCP port to listen on for event streams.

---

`host` _string_

: The host to listen on for event streams.

---

`ssl` _<DocLink id="agentConfigReference" section="tlsconfig" text="typ.TLSConfig" />_

## TLSConfig

Configure a TCP client or server.

```yaml
ssl.verification_mode: full
ssl.supported_protocols: [TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]
ssl.cipher_suites: []
ssl.curve_types: []
```

`supported_protocols` _[]string_

: List of allowed SSL/TLS versions.
If the SSL/TLS server supports none of the specified versions, the connection will be dropped during or after the handshake.

    Valid values:

    - `SSLv3`
    - `TLSv1`
    - `TLSv1.0`
    - `TLSv1.1`
    - `TLSv1.2`
    - `TLSv1.3`

---

`verification_mode` _string_

: Configures the SSL/TLS verification mode used during handshake.

    Valid values:

    - `full` (default)
    - `strict`
    - `certificate`
    - `none`

---

`certificates` _[]string_

: List of certificate chains to present to the other side of the connection.

---

`certificate_authorities` _[]string_

: List of root certificate authorities used to verify server certificates.
If this setting is empty or unset, TLS may use the system's root CA (not supported on MS Windows).

---

`client_certificate_authorities` _[]string_

: List of root certificate authorities to use to verify client certificates.
If this setting is empty or unset, TLS may use the system's root CA set (not supported on MS Windows).

---

`cipher_suites` _[]string_

: List of supported cipher suites.
If nil, a default list provided by the implementation is used.

    For a list of supported cipher suites, see ADD LINK HERE 

---

`curve_types` _[]string_

: List of elliptic curve types to use in an ECDHE handshake.
If empty, the implementation chooses a default.

    Valid values:

    - `P-256`
    - `P-384`
    - `P-521`
    - `X25519`

---

`renegotiation` _string_

: The type of renegotiation that's supported.
The default is correct for the vast majority of applications.

    Valid values:

    - `never` (default)
    - `once`
    - `freely`

---

`verification_mode` _string_

: Controls how certificates from the client are verified.
Does not affect the TCP client.

    Valid values:

    - `none`
    - `optional`
    - `required` (default)

---

`ca_sha256` _string_

: The CA certificate pin used to validate the CA used to trust the server certificate.
The pin is a base64 encoded string of the SHA-256 of the certificate.

    <DocCallOut color="warning" title="Important">
      Do not use this setting with `verification_mode: none`, or the check will always fail because it will not receive any verified chains.
    </DocCallOut>

----

`ca_trusted _fingerprint` _string_

: The HEX-encoded fingerprint of a CA certificate.
If present in the chain, this certificate is added to the list of trusted CAs (root CAs) during the handshake.
